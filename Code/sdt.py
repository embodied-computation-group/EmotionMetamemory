def trials2counts(stimID, response, rating, nRatings, padCells=False,
                  padAmount=None):
    '''Response count.

    Given data from an experiment where an observer discriminates between two
    stimulus alternatives on every trial and provides confidence ratings,
    converts trial by trial experimental information for N trials into response
    counts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    stimID : list or 1d array-like

    response : list or 1d array-like

    rating : list or 1d array-like

    nRatings : int
        Total of available subjective ratings available for the subject. e.g.
        if subject can rate confidence on a scale of 1-4, then nRatings = 4.
    padCells : boolean
        If *True*, each response count in the output has the value of padAmount
        added to it. Padding cells is desirable if trial counts of 0 interfere
        with model fitting. If False, trial counts are not manipulated and 0s
        may be present in the response count output. Default value for padCells
        is 0.
    padAmount : float
        The value to add to each response count if padCells is set to 1.
        Default value is 1/(2*nRatings)

    Returns
    -------
    nR_S1, nR_S2 : list
        Vectors containing the total number of responses in each response
        category, conditional on presentation of S1 and S2.

    Notes
    -----
    All trials where stimID is not 0 or 1, response is not 0 or 1, or
    rating is not in the range [1, nRatings], are omitted from the response
    count.

    If nR_S1 = [100 50 20 10 5 1], then when stimulus S1 was presented, the
    subject had the following response counts:
        responded S1, rating=3 : 100 times
        responded S1, rating=2 : 50 times
        responded S1, rating=1 : 20 times
        responded S2, rating=1 : 10 times
        responded S2, rating=2 : 5 times
        responded S2, rating=3 : 1 time

    The ordering of response / rating counts for S2 should be the same as it
    is for S1. e.g. if nR_S2 = [3 7 8 12 27 89], then when stimulus S2 was
    presented, the subject had the following response counts:
        responded S1, rating=3 : 3 times
        responded S1, rating=2 : 7 times
        responded S1, rating=1 : 8 times
        responded S2, rating=1 : 12 times
        responded S2, rating=2 : 27 times
        responded S2, rating=3 : 89 times

    Examples
    --------
    >>> stimID =    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    >>> response =  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
    >>> rating =    [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    >>> nRatings = 4

    >>> nR_S1, nR_S2 = trials2counts(stimID, response, rating, nRatings,0)
    >>> print(nR_S1, nR_S2)
